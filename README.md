# IsEmpty or ValueIsFilled()

This data processor compares which way to check a reference for empty value works faster:

- `Ref.IsEmpty()`
- `ValueIsFilled(Ref)`

There is a [note](https://kostyanetsky.ru/notes/is-ref-empty) (in Russian) about it on my blog.

Code and interface have made in English. It is worth mentioning that your configuration must have at least one non-empty catalog.
